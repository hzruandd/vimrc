A small plugin to comment, un-comment or toggle one or more lines in both normal and visual mode.

** Usage **
In normal or visual mode:
    q to toggle comment
    shift-q to force comment
    alt-q to force un-comment

Also avaible in command mode:
    Ct to toggle comment
    Cc to force comment
    Cu to force un-comment
These 3 commands are compatible with range and global (:g)


** Examples **
'yyqp' : duplicate and comment an uncommented line
'vjq' : when two lines are [1 commented/1 un-commented], switch the state of each line 
':g!/toto/Cc' : comment all lines which not contain 'toto'


** Remarks **
- The plugin will check the option "&filetype" and the variable "b:current_syntax" to know how to comment the file.
- "echo &filetype" or "echo b:current_syntax" will give you the name of the syntax of the opened file.
- Add a new syntax to the script (or change the default behavior) is very very simple (add only one line), so don't hesitate to adapt the script.
-  For languages like fortran where the rest of the line should not be disturbed by the comment symbol, don't forget to add a line to "s:comment_in_place".
